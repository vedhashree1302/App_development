 Dart â€” Input/Output (I/O) and Loops

This project demonstrates **basic Input/Output (I/O)** operations and **looping constructs** in the Dart programming language.  
It serves as a simple learning example for beginners to understand how Dart handles user input, console output, and control flow through loops.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

The program covers:
- Reading user input from the console using `stdin.readLineSync()`
- Printing formatted output using `print()` and string interpolation
- Using different types of loops:
  - `for` loop
  - `while` loop
  - `do-while` loop
  - `for-in` loop (for iterables)

## ðŸ§  Concepts Covered

### 1. Input and Output (I/O)
- **Input**: Using the `dart:io` library to read data from the user.
- **Output**: Displaying results or messages to the console using `print()`.

### 2. Loops
- **For Loop**: Executes a block of code a fixed number of times.
- **While Loop**: Repeats while a condition is true.
- **Do-While Loop**: Executes at least once before checking the condition.
- **For-in Loop**: Iterates through elements in a list or collection.
